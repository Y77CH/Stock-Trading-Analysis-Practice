# Stock Trading Analysis Practice Project

The project is for me to practice some of the learned data analysis skills, including but not restricted to **Python** (Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas) and other **math** theories. 

In order for this practice to be meaningful (more motivated), I am setting the context to be financial market. 
In the project, I will attempt to analyze and demonstrate an optimal **trading strategy** among five well known single stock firms:

- [Apple Inc. (AAPL)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/) 
- [The Boeing Company (BA)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BA/) 
- [Citigroup Inc. (C)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/C/)
- [Starbucks Corporation (SBUX)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SBUX/) 
- [International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBM/)

*All the data is collected in Yahoo Finance.*

Note:
For simplicity, adjusted close will be considered as daily price.
